								<h2>Scott Neeson</h2>
								<p>Scott was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, before emigrating to Australia at age 5 with his parents and older brother. He grew up in the industrial city of Elizabeth, South Australia. In his later years of university Scott decided to begin to study film - a magical thing back in the '90's. Scott then found work at a movie company, running projecters and fixing broken sets for a small TV show. Slowly, though, he worked his way up the ladder, and became the managing director of a film company, "Hoyts".</p>
								<p>After 5 years of film-making, Neeson became an expert, and decided to relocate to the heart of the film industry, Los Angeles. In 2000, Scott finally reached his dream when he was crowned president of 20th Century Fox.</p>
								<p>Before embarking on a new role at Sony Pictures Entertainment, Scott took a five week trip to Cambodia. Out of curiosity, he asked a friend to show him the 'real Cambodia'. He arrived at the Steung Meanchey garbage dump and took on the most impactful moment in his life. </p>
								<p>“The moment I stepped there it was the single most impactful moment in my life. I was standing there facing into the abyss. The smell was almost visible. There’s this sudden moment when you realise it’s people - it’s children and they’re working. There were kids everywhere. In some cases, they’d been left there by parents that didn’t want them.”</p>
								<p>Scott returned to Los Angeles and tried to help the families from afar, setting up the small business that he named 'Cambodian Children’s Fund'. But as the time went by, he became increasingly tired of his Hollywood life, and realized to make a real difference in Cambodia, he had to move.</p>
								<p>In 2004, Scott sold his house, cars, yacht and held the “mother of all garage sales”. He relocated to Phnom Penh, and began working with the children of Steung Meanchey. From 45 students in the first year, CCF grew under Scott’s guidance to provide education and a pathway out of poverty for more than 2,400 students and their families. </p>

								<h2>My Story</h2>
								<p>I actually have a part in the fund too! I support two siblings, Nati and Phearong. I go to see them once or twice a year, and they are like family to me. We communicate through email, occasionally pulling off a skype call, where they always have a wonderful surprise for us, like a song, or a story. What surprises me most, though, is that Nati and Phearong speak almost no English, but we treat each other like siblings. When they do sing a song on the Skype call, it is always in English - I have never enjoyed hearing 'heads, shoulders, knees, and toes' more in my life!</p>
